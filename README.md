# Ratr: rate anything you'd like

A ratings app that allows the user to rate anything they would like. A user can create, edit, and delete ratings.  I want to be able to keep track of places I've been or things I have tried.

### User Stories
As a user I want to ...
  - create an account
  - sign in to my account
  - change my password if needed
  - sign out of my account
  - create a rating while signed in
  - read ratings while signed in
  - update a rating while signed in
  - delete a rating while signed in

### Technologies used
- jQuery
- HTML/changePassword
- Bootstrap
- Javascript

### Unsolved Problems
- Only display the ratings to the user that they own
- I would like to eventually have different inputs for different categories of ratings
